# Xapu's Sv06 Klipper


### I have been running a Sovol Sv06 klipperized for roughly a year, this repo contains all the configs
### and other stuff usable for me and other Sv06 users to push this machine to its limits while maintaining quality!

# My Sv06 Modifications:
## - All `LM8UU` bearings have been replaced with Igus Drylin bearings, making the Sv06 very quiet!
## - (First Upgrade) RPI400 running Klipper & Mainsail
## - Top Z-Axis bearing mod, this replaced the stock Z leadscrew holders with one where 608 bearings stablize the leadscrew
## - Z-Axis couplers have been replaced with "flexible" (basically bendy couplers) couplers to account for Z leadscrew wobble.
## - Sv06 Plus extruder (MOST USEFULL MOD), this makes my Sv06 reach a volumetric flow of 30mm3s!
## - Bed PEI sheet aligner (free model on printables), makes the alignment of the metalic PEI sheet a breeze!
## - PEI / PEO Sheet
## - Fixed Extruder & Bed ADXLs (Bed: PIS (FYSETC PORTABLE INPUT SHAPER), Extruder: RP2040 + ADXL345)
